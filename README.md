This repository contains the **9th place** (out of 241 teams) solution of the [DhakaAI traffic detection competition](https://dhaka-ai.com/), and incorporates our [evolved hyperparameters](https://github.com/hisham32/yolov5/tree/master/data) by training several configurations of yolov5 models on the competition [dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/POREXF) using the ultralytics [YOLOv5 repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). Our approach in the competition is briefly described in this [poster](https://github.com/hisham32/yolov5/blob/master/Improving%20Vehicle%20Detection%20Using%20YOLOv5%20with%20Hyperparameter%20Evolution%2C%20Data%20Augmentation%20and%20Model%20Ensemble.pdf). The data preprocessing of yolov5 is same as yolov3 and codes are available [here](https://github.com/hisham32/DhakaAI-yolov5/blob/master/DhakaAI_YOLOv5_Data_Preprocessing.ipynb). The training and inference codes are provided [here](https://github.com/hisham32/DhakaAI-yolov5/blob/master/DhakaAI_YOLOv5_Training%2BEvaluation.ipynb). 
**All code and models are under active development, and are subject to modification.**
