This repository contains the 9th place (out of 241 teams) solution of the DhakaAI traffic detection competition, and incorporates our [evolved hyperparameters](yolov5/data) over training several configurations of yolov5 models on competition [dataset](https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/POREXF) with the ultralytics [YOLOv5 repository](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5). Our approach is briefly described in the [poster](https://github.com/hisham32/yolov5/blob/master/Improving%20Vehicle%20Detection%20Using%20YOLOv5%20with%20Hyperparameter%20Evolution%2C%20Data%20Augmentation%20and%20Model%20Ensemble.pdf). The training and inference codes are available inside the [jupyter notebook](yolov5/Transportist_YOLOv5_DhakaAI_Training+Evaluation.ipynb) **All code and models are under active development, and are subject to modification.**
