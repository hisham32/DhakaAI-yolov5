![CI CPU testing](https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov5/workflows/CI%20CPU%20testing/badge.svg)

This repository represents Ultralytics open-source research into future object detection methods, and incorporates our lessons learned and best practices evolved over training thousands of models on custom client datasets with our previous YOLO repository https://github.com/ultralytics/yolov3. **All code and models are under active development, and are subject to modification or deletion without notice.** Use at your own risk.


## Requirements
